Our purpose is to understand how to store this login/password pair on the server.  If the database is stolen we want the attackers not to be able to access the account itself or make this process as labor-intensive as possible.

## Plain-text storage
We store the password in clear text, here it was `qwerty` and write `qwerty` to the database

Everything should be obvious here, the database was stolen means that all passwords were stolen. A real gift to the attacker, please do not be so generous. 

Also, remember to remove sensitive data if you use loggers inside your application. Ensure you donâ€™t keep plain-text passwords (for example if you log data from an API endpoint) even if you protect your passwords on the DB side and the attacker wonâ€™t be able to see them inside logs.

```
{"login": "john", "password": "**removed**"}
```

is much better than

```
{"login": "john", "password": "qwerty"}
```

## Store password as a hash 
According to the definition, a hash function is an irreversible function.

Just a simple example: letâ€™s say that  f(x) = x % 10 will be our hash function. 
```
 f(x) = x % 10
 f(123456789) = 12345679 % 10 = 9 
```

As you can see in the previous example. You canâ€™t get 123456789 back using 9. Because all the numbers ending with 9 will hash to f(x) = 9. 
In plain words, a hashing algorithm is a mathematical function that garbles data and makes it unreadable. 

Letâ€™s store a hash of the password, for example, take one of the most popular algorithms MD5 (NB: Itâ€™s highly not recommended for storing passwords) 

```
md5(qwerty) = 897c8fde25c5cc5270cda61425eed3c8
```

As we already discussed, there is no way to get `qwerty` from `897c8fde25c5cc5270cda61425eed3c8` in a computational way. But an attacker can generate a table with cryptographic hash values from the passphrase. So, an attacker with access to the hashes can quickly check the list of possible passwords for validity. These tables are called rainbow tables.
You can do such a simple trick - take the database of popular passwords and run MD5 through it, you get a dictionary where `qwerty` corresponds to `897c8fde25c5cc5270cda61425eed3c8`. 
This dictionary can be expanded and attackers already have millions of compromised passwords inside rainbow tables. 

## Store password as a hash + salt 
For better security, we can add some random phrase called salt before hashing the passphrase.  

```
md5(qwerty + !@#$%1234) = 908fa378d5573b73db62135e61fc901e
```

This solution is much better than the previous one, passwords wonâ€™t leak right away, but if an attacker finds out the secret, then making a new table is generally not so difficult. An attacker can brute force this salt or give a bribe to the worker responsible for the environment. 

If there is a strong financial motivation making it can be a matter of a few days. 

## Store password as hash + salt with some user-specific attribute 

We can add some value specific to each user to the secret, for example, his id:  `md5(password+secret+id)`
